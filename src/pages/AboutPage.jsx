                <p style={{textAlign :'center'}}>October 19,1954 saw the beginning of a new phase in Bapuji’s career when he laid the foundation of a new education institute in the presence of his colleagues in Murlidhar temple at Karad. In November,1954, the proposed educational institute was named after Shri Swami Vivekanand at the instance of Swami Ramanand Bharti, the first president of the sanstha. Shri Swami Vivekanand Sanstha was duly registered on 31st of December 1954;and started functioning on the 5th of june 1955. Bapuji and his colleagues set up highschool at Kolhapur,Tasgaon ,Chaphal,Tarale and Undale; a training college for women at Karad,Boys’.Hostels at Kolhapur and Chaphal. This was only the modest beginning of Shri Swami Vivekanand Shikshan Sanstha that was soon to be developed in to 88652 students into the states of Maharastra and Karnataka. The sanstha has the most impressive number of 3160 teaching staff,1221 non-teaching and office staff. The sanstha owns 176 buildings and 70 new buildings are being constructed along with the construction of the new head office. The sanstha has also opened a credit society for its employees.
